# DineDiscover

## Overview

DineDiscover is a web application built using React and Next.js, which allows its users to search and view dining spots with an interative and fun approach.
This is made possible by integrating the Google Places & Maps API, which provides detailed information that is delicately processed with care by the involved developers of this project to ultimately present you, the user with an eye-candy enhanced experience to consume.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a robust and intuitive application that enhances the user experience of searching for and finding restaurants and cafes. Leveraging the power of Next.js and the Google Places API, we aim to deliver a fast and responsive experience with high usability and functionality.

DineDiscover aims simplifying the picking process of your next dining spot.

## Motivation

We chose React with Next.js for this project over Due and Angular for several reasons. One of these reasons is Reactâ€™s  documentation and strong community support making it easy to find the resources needed. Additionally, all team members have prior experience with React from smaller projects, so continuing with it allows us to build on our existing knowledge.

Another reason is React's component-based architecture which promotes modular and reusable code, making our application easier to manage. Next.js also offers a built-in routing system, simplifying navigation within the app.
