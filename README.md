# DineDiscover

## Overview

DineDiscover is a web application built using React and Next.js, which allows its users to search and view dining spots with an interative and fun approach.
This is made possible by integrating the Google Places & Maps API, which provides detailed information that is delicately processed with care by the involved developers of this project to ultimately present you, the user with an eye-candy enhanced experience to consume.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a robust and intuitive application that enhances the user experience of searching for and finding restaurants and cafes. Leveraging the power of Next.js and the Google Places API, we aim to deliver a fast and responsive experience with high usability and functionality.

DineDiscover aims simplifying the picking process of your next dining spot.

## Motivation

- **Next.js Routing**: Next.js offers simple and efficient routing, perfect for our project.
- **Server-Side API Requests**: Google Places API requires requests to be made from the server-side to protect the API key and enhance security.
- **Server-Side Design**: Next.js is optimized for server-side rendering, improving performance and SEO.
- **Client-Side Alternatives**: If necessary, we can use the JavaScript kit for the client-side or a proxy to handle API requests.
